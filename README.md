# Jenkins Pipeline Script Documentation

This documentation explains a Jenkins pipeline script that generates an HTML report containing information about Jenkins nodes, Docker cloud templates, and Kubernetes cloud templates. The script is written in Groovy and is designed to run as a Jenkins pipeline job.

## Overview

The script collects data about Jenkins nodes and cloud configurations and presents it in a structured HTML report format. The information includes details about Jenkins slaves/nodes, Docker cloud templates, and Kubernetes cloud templates.

## Usage

To use this script in Jenkins, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.

2. Paste the script into the pipeline definition.

3. Ensure that your Jenkins environment has the required libraries and plugins installed.

4. Customize the script as needed to match your Jenkins configuration and cloud templates.

## Script Sections

The script is divided into several sections:

- Import Statements: Import necessary Groovy and Jenkins libraries.

- Pipeline Definition: Defines the main Jenkins pipeline with a single stage.

- Stages and Steps: The "Test" stage contains various steps.

- Functions: Several functions are defined to collect data and generate the HTML report. These include functions like `getDockerTemplates`, `parseJsonForXml`, and more.

- HTML Report: The report is generated using a Groovy `MarkupBuilder`, and it includes information about Jenkins nodes, cloud configurations, and their templates.

- `isSDP` Function: Determines if a Docker image is provided by the SDP (Software Delivery Platform) team based on the image name.

- `getDocumentationURL` Function: Constructs a URL for the documentation of an SDP Docker image.

- `getCSS` Function: Returns a CSS stylesheet for styling the HTML report.

## Customization

The script may require customization to match your Jenkins environment's specific configuration and the Docker/Kubernetes cloud templates you use. Make sure to adapt the script to your needs.
